### Testing (Build from Source)

The testing suite for this package makes use of a ros1 bag, and depends on the following [repo](https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2_bag_v2). In order to get it to work
you need to source both the ros1 underlay and the ros2 underlay in your ~/.bashrc file. Do this in a new terminal. 

```
# ROS1 
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash

# ROS2
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
source /usr/share/colcon_cd/function/colcon_cd.sh 
export _colcon_cd_root=/opt/ros/foxy

```
